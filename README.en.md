# Question Campus

## Platform Introduction

Informationization of campus walls has always been a gap. There are many questions that students have on campus, but
there is no platform for them to ask questions, nor a platform for them to answer questions. Our platform was born to
solve this problem. Our platform allows students to ask and answer questions on campus. Compared with other forum
platforms that recommend posts based on users' preferences, our platform recommends posts based on the popularity of
questions, so that we can balance the posts that users want to see and the current hot posts.
